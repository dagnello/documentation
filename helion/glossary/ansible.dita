        <p>Ansible is an IT automation tool. It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks 
        such as continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates.</p>
        <!--<p>
        Ansible’s main goals are simplicity and ease-of-use. It also has a strong focus on security and reliability, featuring a minimum 
        of moving parts, usage of OpenSSH for transport (with an accelerated socket mode and pull modes as alternatives), and a language 
        that is designed around auditability by humans–even those not familiar with the program.</p>
